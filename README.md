This is a basic HTML website, made to polish my (very unpolished) HTML
skills. By the end of making this website I should have learned how to:
- Work with git in a basic manner
- Utilize lists
- Link pages
- Use the img element
- Use the paragraph element
- Effectively use bold/strong and em/italic elements
- Write HTML comments that make sense
